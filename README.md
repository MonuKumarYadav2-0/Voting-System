# Project Title: Simple Voting System

## Project Description

The Simple Voting System is a decentralized application that enables users to cast votes for registered candidates securely on the blockchain. Admins can add candidates and control when voting begins.

## Key Features

- On-chain result retrieval

## Future Scope
